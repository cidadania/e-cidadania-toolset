e-cidadania toolset
===================

**Version:** *0.1 alpha*

e-cidadania toolset is a set of tools for automating some tasks like
documentation, nightlies, i18n catalogs, etc.

*This toolset is still on development, since most of the tools are scattered through the e-cidadania repositories. We recommend people to use the integrated
scripts in e-cidadania while we port them here.*
